# SampleCodeBase

This is a sample code base containing non-standard C# code as an example of bad code base. We need to cover this bad code base such a way so that it covers most of the code blocks.

## Advise (Must follow)

Avoid the structures (variable naming, multiple defination in the file). We will not accept if output code or generator code contains multiple defination in one file (weather it is enum, struct or simple class). These are exmaples given of bad code base.

## Participants Excercise

Participants must follow the instructions from the bootcamp assignments, plus, they need to create actual tests in this project to cover 100% of selected code blocks. For example, if the assignment is to cover generics class, then it need to cover all generic class methods including it's private methods.
